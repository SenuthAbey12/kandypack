# KandyPack Monorepo

This repository contains:

- A React frontend (root `package.json`)
- An Express/MySQL backend (`backend/` with its own `package.json`)

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for a full overview of structure, database notes, and start scripts.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
npm --prefix backend install
```

Run in development (starts backend in another PowerShell and frontend locally):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Or run separately:

```powershell
npm --prefix backend run dev
npm start
```

Build frontend:

```powershell
npm run build
```

## Environment Variables
Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set values locally. Do not commit `.env`.

Required (backend): `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PORT`, `PORT`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`.

## Why two node_modules?

The frontend and backend are separate Node projects with different dependencies and scripts. Each installs its own `node_modules` (`/node_modules` and `/backend/node_modules`). This is expected.

## Database Schema

- `backend/setup_database.sql` — initial core schema and seed.
- `backend/database/portal_schema_update.sql` — portal-oriented additions. Standardization recommended (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## Notes

- `build/` is generated by `npm run build` and should not be committed.
- Some queries may execute twice in development due to `React.StrictMode` (expected behavior in React 18 dev).
